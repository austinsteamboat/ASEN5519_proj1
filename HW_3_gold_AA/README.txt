Park_alg_run.m - script to run park algorithm simulation

Park_alg_delay_run.m - script to run the park algorithm with simulated delay

LGF_alg_run_symb.m - script to run the Guidance Field algorithm simulation

LGF_alg_run_symb_delay.m - script to run the LGF algorithm with simulated delay

file_gen.m - not needed to run anything, but this is the script that was 
used to generate v1_run.m and alpha_run.m. As they were auto-generated,
the commenting in them isn't useful so look to this script for insight.

All the scripts simulate the aircraft dynamics in a software loop using
small time steps to numerically integrate or differntiate the aircraft 
states.
